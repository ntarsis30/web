	<h2>
		Different Colors
	</h2>
	
	<p>Most animals, including us humans see the world with three color receptors. For us, these are red, green, and blue.
	With these initial colors, every thing else that we see is merely a combiantion of these three colors(except for yellow, but green is blue+yellow).
	However, mantis shrimps have 12 of these color receptors. While this doesn't allow them to see different colors than us, they can take in information and react
	much more quickly. To further understand how it works, suppose the shrimp sees a fish. The shrimp would then remember how the receptor excitation associated with that fish, 
	so if the same information was relayed, the shrimp would automatically realize that it was the same fish. When coupled with the fact, that its eyes rotate freely in all 
	three dimensions, it becomes clear that these animals see the world in a n=very fascinating way.</p>

	<h2>
		Being Really Strong
	</h2>
	
	<p>As hunters, mantis shrims need a wat to subdue their prey. They use two dactyl clubs, and hold them similarly to a praying mantis. 
	When the shrimps come near their prey, these clubs are released and they can pack quite a punch. One ver similar to that a small bullet in fact(around 200 pounds).
	What's more is that these clubs can travel around 20 meters per second(50 mph) and the water near those clubs can reach heats similar to that of the sun's surface.
	As a result, unfortunately mantis shrimp are very hard to come across in aquariums as cases of these clubs breaking the glass are very common. Another really nice thing is
	that new types of hard materials have been made by analyzing these clubs to make new forms of armor.</p>

		Experienced Veterans of Earth
	</h2>
	
	<p>The two earlier cool things may make you think that mantis shrimps have only recently joined our world's biosphere because of how revolutionary they appear. 
	However, mantis shrimps have been around for millions of years. In fact, they appeared wy before even the dinosaurs, 400 millions years to be exact. Thus, there 
	are hundreds of similiarly cool variations of mantis shrimps on our planet. The two major types are the smashers and the spearers. The first one is self-explanitory, 
	they come after their prey and just smash them with their clubs. Contrarily, the spearers use ambush techniques to attack unsuspecting prey.</p>
